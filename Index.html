    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three main types of text formatting. Those are <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underling</u>.</p>

    <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
    <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and header elements are block elements. An <b>inline element</b> does not display its content on a new line. It keep
    the content on the same line as the previous content. Bold, italics and underline are all inline elements.</p>

    <h3><u>Block Element Examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This is a paragraph on the same line in the code as the
    previous paragraph, but it still moves to the next line.<p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element. </p>this is the nested block<p><p>

    <h3>Inline Elements Example</h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>an inline element</b>. Notice how the inline element does not move to a new line.</p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two element that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b> elements adds an empty line and moves the content down to a line. Its
        similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in a Google/word doc. A <b>horizontal rule</b> is a line break with a horizontal
        bar across the page. Both of these are block elements.</p>
        <p>Below this paragraph is a line break</p>
        <br>
        <p>Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
        <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #f05454"> Images</h1>
    <p>An <b>image element</b> is an <i>inline</i> element which inserts pictures into the document. An image element is self-closing, which means it does not have a closing tag. it has one major attribute is self-closing,
    which mean it does not have closing tag. Ihas one major attribute, src, which is a filepath that points to the images' location. Those filepaths can either be
    <b>absolute</b> or <b>relative</b>.</p>

    <h2>Simple Image Example</h2>
    <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/12/01/20/28/road-1072823__340.jpg">

    <h2>Image Attributes</h2>
    <p>There are 4 attributes commonly used for images. <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are used to resize the images. <i>alt</i> allows to use text description of images for
    accessibility and broken images. <i>title</i> allows a hover-over text to appear.</p>

    <h3>Width and Height</h3>
    <p>The width and height cna be measured in many different ways, but the more </p>

    <h3>Alt Attribute</h3>
    <p>EVERY picture should have the alt attribute. The alt attribute helps with screen readers for visually impaired and in the cases that the image is broken.</p>

    <h2>Relative vs. Absolute</h2>
    <p>An <b>absolute</b> filepath includes all the navigation to get to the server, folder and file. The example above are all absolute filepaths.
    An absolute file path is used when the image is stored on different server or device then the HTML document.</p>

    <p>A <b>relative</b> filepath only includes folder and files. the example below is a relative filepath. A relative filepath is used
    when the images are store alongside the HTML document.</p>

    <img src="nature.jpeg" width="150px" alt="river running through taiga and mountains">

    <h1 style="color: #f05454">Links</h1>
    <p>The <b>anchor element</b> is an <i>inline element</i> and is a way to include hypertext link,
    otherwise known as just links, in your document. An anchor is a reference point for other document or
    files. It commonly has 3 attributed: <i>href</i>, <i>target</i> and <i>download.</i></p>

    <h2>A Simple Link</h2>
    <a href="http://ihasabucket.com/"> Link</a>


    <p>In order for the link to work it <b>MUST</b> include the <i>href</i> attribute. This attribute is the
    filepath, either absolute or relative, to the document, website or file you wish to link.</p>

    <h2>Link Attributes</h2>
    <p>The <i>target</i> attribute you to decide where the link opens. There are 4 options, but we
    will only discuss two in this course. <i>_blank</i> opens the linked document</p>

    <a href="http://ihasabucket.com/"> Link</a>

    <p>The <i>download</i> attribute allows you to download the file or document linked and assign it a new filename. This
    is commonly used onl with relative filepaths.</p>

    <a href="nature.jpeg" download="naturepic"></a>

    <h2>A picture as Link</h2>
    <p>since a lick has a opening AND closing tag, we can place ANY HTML ELEMENT as its content, which
    includes pictures. We simply nest the img element inside the anchor element.</p>

    <a href="http://ihasabucket.com" target="_blank">
        <img src="nature.jpeg" width="150px" alt="river running through taiga and mountains">
