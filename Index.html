    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three main types of text formatting. Those are <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underling</u>.</p>

    <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
    <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and header elements are block elements. An <b>inline element</b> does not display its content on a new line. It keep
    the content on the same line as the previous content. Bold, italics and underline are all inline elements.</p>

    <h3><u>Block Element Examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This is a paragraph on the same line in the code as the
    previous paragraph, but it still moves to the next line.<p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element. </p>this is the nested block<p><p>

    <h3>Inline Elements Example</h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>an inline element</b>. Notice how the inline element does not move to a new line.</p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two element that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b> elements adds an emepty line and moves the content down to a line. Its
        similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in a Google/word doc. A <b>horizontal rule</b> is a line break with a horizontal
        bar across the page. Both of these are block elements.</p>
        <p>Below this paragraph is a line break</p>
        <br>
        <p>Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
        <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>
