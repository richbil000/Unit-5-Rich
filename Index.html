    <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>

    the content on the same line as the previous content. Bold, italics and underline are all inline elements.</p>

    previous paragraph, but it still moves to the next line.<p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two element that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b> elements adds an empty line and moves the content down to a line. Its
        similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in a Google/word doc. A <b>horizontal rule</b> is a line break with a horizontal
        bar across the page. Both of these are block elements.</p>
